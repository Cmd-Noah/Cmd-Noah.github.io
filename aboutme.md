### My story

I was born in a small town in the UK, went to a public primary school, once finished with primary I moved to a secondary school which I then got a job at domino's which I learnt the basis of how work is, and how to work as a team in a fast paced environment, during that time I would have to be on a till at the front transacting fast-paced microtranscations, at this age I also dabbled into building computers there is **[images here](https://imgur.com/a/ysQv1PA)**.
